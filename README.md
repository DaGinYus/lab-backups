# lab-backups
Backups of python scripts created for physics lab. They have been converted from jupyter notebooks. The scripts are mostly for data analysis and plotting. There are a few with curve fitting as well. For data manipulation I use numpy and scipy, and for graphing I use matplotlib. These are all created in a short timeframe (during lab time) so emphasis is on functional code.
